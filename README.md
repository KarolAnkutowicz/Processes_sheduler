# Processes_sheduler

The program enables the execution of process scheduling algorithms on a given or randomly selected process database. 

Using algorithms:
- non preemprion:
    * FCFS (First-Come, First-Served);
    * LCFS (Last-Come, First-Served);
    * SJF (Shortest Job Next);
- preemprion:
    * Round-Robin;
    * SRT (Shortest Remaining Time).

Additionally:
- draw processes;
- read processes from file;
- write processes to file;
- write algorithms result to file.
